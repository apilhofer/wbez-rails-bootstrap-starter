# AGENTS.md

This is a Rails 8 application template for WBEZ-style prototyping. It uses:
- Rails 8
- Hotwire/Turbo
- Stimulus
- Bootstrap
- ERB partials
- Local WBEZ/Ferris brand assets (logos + icons)

The purpose of this project is to help build new Rails interfaces that feel consistent with WBEZ editorial and product patterns while remaining fast to prototype.

## Architecture rules
- Prefer Rails-native patterns first: ERB partials, helpers, Turbo, and Stimulus.
- Do not introduce React, Vue, Tailwind, daisyUI, or client-side component frameworks unless explicitly requested.
- Reuse shared UI partials in `app/views/shared/ui` before creating one-off markup.
- If a new UI pattern is likely to be reused, extract a partial instead of copying markup.
- Keep controllers thin; prefer helpers and partial composition for display logic.
- Do not modify the application root route when adding demo pages or internal reference pages.

## Design system rules
- Use Bootstrap for layout, spacing, forms, nav, tables, buttons, cards, alerts, badges, pagination, and responsive structure.
- Layer WBEZ styling on top of Bootstrap rather than replacing Bootstrap with a custom utility system.
- Use `docs/design-system/bootstrap-wbez.md` and `docs/design-system/cursor-native-guide.md` as the primary style references.
- Keep pages restrained, content-first, readable, and high-contrast.
- Prefer editorial hierarchy over generic “app chrome.”

## Typography rules
- Use Source Sans Pro / sans-serif for UI, labels, forms, nav, metadata, and utility text.
- Use Charter / serif styling for editorial headlines, subheads, long-form story titles, and pull quotes.
- Use `.prose-wbez` for article bodies and long-form content on WBEZ pages; use `.prose-suntimes` inside `.suntimes-prototype` for Sun-Times article bodies.
- Wrap brand-specific pages in `.wbez-prototype` or `.suntimes-prototype` so SCSS under `app/assets/stylesheets/brands/` applies predictably.

## Shared UI inventory
Prefer these before writing new markup:
- `shared/ui/site_header_wbez` (WBEZ masthead; `shared/ui/site_header` is a thin alias)
- `shared/ui/site_header_suntimes` (Chicago Sun-Times masthead; do not use WBEZ header on CST pages)
- `shared/ui/site_footer` (WBEZ)
- `shared/ui/site_footer_suntimes` (Sun-Times)
- `shared/ui/section_header`
- `shared/ui/story_card`
- `shared/ui/hero_story`
- `shared/ui/article_header`
- `shared/ui/article_shell` (WBEZ article layout)
- `shared/ui/article_shell_suntimes` (Sun-Times article layout)
- `shared/ui/figure`
- `shared/ui/pull_quote`
- `shared/ui/responsive_embed`
- `shared/ui/alert`
- `shared/ui/badge`
- `shared/ui/button`
- `shared/ui/card`
- `shared/ui/field`
- `shared/ui/tabs`
- `shared/ui/pagination`

## Icon and logo rules
- Ferris icons are local SVG files in `app/assets/images/icons`.
- Always render Ferris icons with `ferris_icon` or `inline_svg`.
- Do not use `image_tag` for Ferris icons, because external image rendering will not inherit `currentColor`.
- Local logos live in `app/assets/images/logos`.
- Use `/demo/icons` and `/demo/logos` as the reference pages for available assets.

## Editorial patterns
- Use `/demo/article` as the canonical article example.
- Use `/demo/home` as the canonical homepage-style example.
- Use `/demo/cookbook` as the canonical editorial-pattern reference.
- Prefer kicker → headline → dek → metadata → body hierarchy for stories.
- Prefer real editorial modules such as pull quotes, figures, embeds, and related content blocks over generic cards dropped into article bodies.

## Hotwire/Turbo rules
- Keep forms and links Turbo-compatible by default.
- Prefer Turbo Frames for scoped updates.
- Use Stimulus only for light progressive enhancement.
- Do not replace standard Rails behavior with unnecessary JavaScript.

## Demo route rules
- Demo pages are development-only reference pages.
- Allowed demo routes include `/demo`, `/demo/home`, `/demo/article`, `/demo/logos`, `/demo/icons`, and `/demo/cookbook`.
- Demo routes must never override the app root route.

## When extending the system
When asked to build a new page:
1. Reuse shared partials first.
2. Follow Bootstrap layout conventions.
3. Apply WBEZ editorial hierarchy and typography.
4. Use local logos/icons/helpers.
5. Keep the result easy to refactor into reusable UI.
